# APR-Strategy-Overlay
Simhub overlay designed to sit on and around your mirror.

Includes a simplified version of Bosch Collision Avoidance System.

**How To Get the dash with Github**

1. Clone this repo to a folder outside Simhub.

2. Hard link the folder containing the dash  to the SimHub directory so you can make changes and use them, while also having `git` able to see the files and their changes (example from my machine):
   
   > mklink /J "C:\Program Files\SimHub\DashTemplates\APR Strategy Overlay" "C:\Users\bruce\Documents\GitHub\APR-Strategy-overlay\APR Strategy Overlay"
